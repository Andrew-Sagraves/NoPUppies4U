#User Password Tester
Harrison Clark

This program tests to ese whether users have a password or not, and especially whether or not they have a password and are root. This technology will be incredibly important for our security testing because it allows us to check whether or not an attacker could access a root user account and use it for maliciousness. It tests this by using a variety of different includes to check these files, including in particular <pwd.h>. To run it, just run: 

g++ hclark37.cpp
./a.out
