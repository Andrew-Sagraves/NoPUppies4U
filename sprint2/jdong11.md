## Use of AI and/or 3rd party software
I used Github Copilot to help provide small code snippets and suggestions. I used ChatGPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4 on my Project.
## What you accomplished
I was able to set up firewall checker and fix the issue where the sources.list parser is not worker.

## Retrospective
I feel like I could make better use of the AI to do repetitive stuff on check_ufw() function because a lot of the code is just repeating stuff.
