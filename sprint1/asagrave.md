What you planned to do

I created functions that returned a vector of strings containing the $PATH directories
I created functions that got any vulnerabilities inside the $PATH and outputted it to another file
What you did not do
Unable to complete looking at the sudoers files due to the cronjob files taking longer than expected

What problems you encountered
Making an incorrect estimate of the time to complete my assigned issues
There were some git issues, but those were solved soon

Issues you worked on
#3 - had everything in it

Files you worked on
asagrave.cpp
asagrave.h
Use of AI and/or 3rd party software
I used chatgpt and guided it through my own function templates, helping it to fill code in. I verbosely described the code logic i needed and let chatgpt fill it in

What you accomplished
I checked the $PATH envireoment variable for common vulnerabilities and outputted any vulnerabilities to a seperate file
