# Sprint 3
- Harrison Clark
- hclark37
- NoPuppies4U

### What you planned to do
- https://github.com/Andrew-Sagraves/NoPUppies4U/issues/27 Issue # 27 - Start on adding verbose output options
- Add a flag that sets verbose output
- Implement it into people's code to show a template for it
- Set up framework for others to setup their own verbose input 

- https://github.com/Andrew-Sagraves/NoPUppies4U/issues/26 Issue # 26 - Implement the features of others into main
- Add every new function to main with flags
- Add new functions to manual pages 

- https://github.com/Andrew-Sagraves/NoPUppies4U/issues/25 Issue # 25 - Implement directory flags for other people's logs
- Set up flags that take in directory as input
- Implement that to be passed for every function that takes directories as input 

### What you did not do
- I wasn't necessarily able to debug every feature that was added to the program. I know that that is partially a step for sprint 4, but that could use some more work. The code runs and compiles, however. 

### What problems you encountered
- Coordinating with others for when different parts of the program get done. 
- Navigating modifying someone elses' code with their commits so that pepople's work doesn't get overwritten.
  
### Issues you worked on
- https://github.com/Andrew-Sagraves/NoPUppies4U/issues/26 Issue # 26
- https://github.com/Andrew-Sagraves/NoPUppies4U/issues/27 Issue # 27
- https://github.com/Andrew-Sagraves/NoPUppies4U/issues/27 Issue # 27
  
### Files you worked on
- main.cpp
- asagraves.cpp
- man/nopuppies4u.1

### Use of AI and/or 3rd party software
- Did not have to use it at all for this sprint.
  
### What you accomplished
I was able to implement a feature for verbose output that works via a global variable between all the different files that people have. I was able to implement every new function into main, and modify 
existing functions to work with the new directories functionality. I was able to add manual pages for these new fucntions. I was able to fix issues that made the code not able to compile or otherwise
not intended, and fixed all compile-time warnings with the program.
