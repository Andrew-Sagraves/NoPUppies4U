## What you planned to do

- Parsing Application Logs
- Updating Existing Functions
## What you did not do

## What problems you encountered
- Determining where to check for hidden folders
## Issues you worked on
- [#28](https://github.com/Andrew-Sagraves/NoPUppies4U/issues/17)
## Files you worked on

## Use of AI and/or 3rd party software
I used Github Copilot to help provide small code snippets and suggestions. I also used Google Gemini 2.5 to help with some logic errors and bug fixing.
## What you accomplished
I was able to use the existing parse logs function to create two new logs to search and created an all in one parse all logs function.
I also added the ability to ignore hidden folders when checking for the check_directory_for_changes() and the ability to ignore file output using the verbose flag.
